# Specific Results vs Generic Praise

## WEAK
> "I'm a huge fan of the brand, so I'm glad I could finally sample their product."
>
> — Gavin J.

### Why it's weak:
- No specific result or metric
- First initial only (unverifiable)
- Could be written for any product
- Tells you nothing about the product quality
- No context about who Gavin is
- Adds zero credibility

## STRONG
> "Our team just loves how easy to use the software is and **support response time improved by 22%** in month one."
>
> — Dave Lewis, VP of Customer Relations, Starbucks

### Why it works:
- Specific metric (22% improvement)
- Specific timeframe (month one)
- Full name and title
- Recognizable company
- Highlights specific feature (ease of use)
- Addresses implicit objection (does it actually work?)

## Teaching Point
A testimonial should do work—it should highlight a feature, answer a doubt, or prove a result. Generic praise is just filler that takes up space without adding credibility.

## When to Apply
When collecting or selecting testimonials, ask: "What does this testimonial PROVE?" If you can't answer that, it's not worth including.

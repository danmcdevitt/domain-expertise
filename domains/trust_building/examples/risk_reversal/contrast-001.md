# Bold Guarantee vs Weak Guarantee

## WEAK
"Satisfaction guaranteed. Terms and conditions apply. Refunds subject to manager approval within 14 days of purchase."

### Why it's weak:
- "Terms and conditions apply" creates uncertainty
- "Subject to approval" = they might say no
- 14 days isn't enough to really evaluate
- Buried conditions increase anxiety
- Feels like a loophole, not a promise
- Reader worries about the fine print

## STRONG
"Try it for 60 days. If you don't see measurable improvement in your conversion rates, email us and we'll refund every penny. No questions asked. No hoops. We'll even let you keep the bonus materials."

### Why it works:
- Specific timeframe (60 days)
- Tied to specific outcome (measurable improvement)
- Clear process (just email)
- Unconditional ("no questions asked")
- Extra generosity ("keep the bonus materials")
- Projects confidence in the product

## Teaching Point
A strong guarantee is a marketing tool, not a liability. The bolder your guarantee, the more confident you appear in your product. Most people never use guarantees anyway—but knowing it's there removes the final barrier.

## When to Apply
Ask yourself: "What guarantee would make ME comfortable buying this from a stranger on the internet?" Then offer that. If you're not confident enough to offer it, improve your product.

# Testimonial Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose
Evaluate testimonials for credibility and conversion effectiveness.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Specificity (Weight: 35%)
- Does the testimonial include specific results or metrics?
- Are there concrete details (numbers, timeframes, features)?
- Does it describe a specific experience, not just satisfaction?
- Would this be hard to fake?

**Red Flags:**
- Generic praise ("Great product!")
- No measurable outcomes
- Vague descriptors ("amazing," "game-changer")
- Could apply to any similar product

### 2. Credibility Markers (Weight: 25%)
- Full name included?
- Photo included?
- Title/company included?
- Is the person verifiable?

**Red Flags:**
- First name only ("John S.")
- No photo or stock photo
- No title or company context
- Clearly fictional attribution

### 3. Demographic Match (Weight: 25%)
- Does the testimonial giver match the target audience?
- Would the target visitor identify with this person?
- Is the context similar to the visitor's situation?

**Red Flags:**
- Enterprise testimonial on SMB page
- B2B testimonial on consumer page
- Irrelevant industry or role
- Mismatch between testimonial giver and target buyer

### 4. Objection Handling (Weight: 15%)
- Does the testimonial address a common objection?
- Does it highlight a specific feature or benefit?
- Does it answer a doubt a prospect might have?

**Red Flags:**
- Pure emotional satisfaction without substance
- Doesn't address any specific concern
- Generic praise that teaches nothing

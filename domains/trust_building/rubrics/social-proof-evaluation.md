# Social Proof Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose
Evaluate the overall social proof strategy for credibility and placement.

## Types of Social Proof

1. **Customer Testimonials** - Quotes from customers
2. **Customer Logos** - Recognizable brands that use the product
3. **Quantifiable Stats** - "Used by 10,000+ companies"
4. **Third-Party Reviews** - Trustpilot, G2, Capterra
5. **Real-Time Proof** - "12 people bought this today"
6. **Media Mentions** - "Featured in Forbes"
7. **Expert Endorsements** - Industry authority validation

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Variety and Coverage (Weight: 25%)
- Are multiple types of social proof used?
- Is there proof at different stages of the page?
- Are different objections addressed by different proof types?

**Red Flags:**
- Only one type of social proof
- All proof clustered in one section
- Missing proof types for key objections

### 2. Strategic Placement (Weight: 30%)
- Is proof placed near decision points (CTAs, pricing)?
- Is proof early enough to build initial trust?
- Is proof near high-anxiety elements (forms, checkout)?

**Red Flags:**
- All proof at bottom of page
- No proof near CTAs
- No proof on high-friction steps

### 3. Specificity and Credibility (Weight: 25%)
- Are numbers specific (not rounded)?
- Are stats recent and relevant?
- Are sources verifiable?
- Do logos/mentions link to context?

**Red Flags:**
- "Thousands of customers" instead of specific number
- Outdated stats ("Since 2015...")
- Unverifiable claims
- Generic badges without meaning

### 4. Audience Relevance (Weight: 20%)
- Does proof match target audience's context?
- Would target visitor find these sources credible?
- Is proof from people/companies they'd respect?

**Red Flags:**
- Impressive but irrelevant logos
- Proof from wrong industry/size
- Authority sources visitor wouldn't recognize

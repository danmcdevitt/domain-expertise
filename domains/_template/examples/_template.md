# [Topic]: [Aspect] Contrast

> Teaching [what this example teaches] through WEAK vs STRONG comparison.

## Scenario

**Context**: [The situation - what's being created and why]
**Audience**: [Who this is for - their awareness level, needs, concerns]
**Goal**: [What success looks like - the desired outcome]

---

## WEAK Version

```
[The weak example - actual content that someone might produce]
```

### Analysis: Why This Fails

| Issue | Explanation | Principle Violated |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Issue 1] | [Why it's a problem and what harm it causes] | [Principle name from principles.md] |
| [Issue 2] | [Why it's a problem] | [Principle name] |
| [Issue 3] | [Why it's a problem] | [Principle name] |

**Impact**: [What happens as a result of these issues - lost conversions, confusion, etc.]

---

## STRONG Version

```
[The strong example - actual content that demonstrates excellence]
```

### Analysis: Why This Works

| Strength | Explanation | Principle Applied |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| [Strength 1] | [Why it works and what benefit it creates] | [Principle name] |
| [Strength 2] | [Why it works] | [Principle name] |
| [Strength 3] | [Why it works] | [Principle name] |

**Impact**: [What this achieves - conversions, trust, clarity, etc.]

## The Transformation

Key changes from WEAK to STRONG:

1. **[Change category 1]**:
   - Before: [What the weak version did]
   - After: [What the strong version does]
   - Why: [The reasoning behind this change]

2. **[Change category 2]**:
   - Before: [Weak approach]
   - After: [Strong approach]
   - Why: [Reasoning]

3. **[Change category 3]**:
   - Before: [Weak approach]
   - After: [Strong approach]
   - Why: [Reasoning]

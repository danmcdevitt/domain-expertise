# Hero Section Value Proposition

## WEAK
"Welcome to DataSync Pro

We are the industry's leading data synchronization platform. Our award-winning solution helps businesses of all sizes manage their data more effectively.

[Learn More] [Contact Sales] [Watch Demo]"

### Why it's weak:
- "Welcome to" wastes prime real estate on a greeting
- Self-congratulatory ("industry's leading", "award-winning")
- Vague benefit ("manage data more effectively")
- Three CTAs competing for attention
- Focused on company, not visitor

## STRONG
"Stop Losing Leads to CRM Sync Errors

Your sales team closes 23% more deals when lead data syncs in real-time—not 24 hours later.

[Start Free Trial - No Credit Card]"

### Why it works:
- Specific problem the reader recognizes
- Quantified outcome (23% more deals)
- Specific mechanism (real-time vs 24 hours)
- Single, low-friction CTA
- Focused entirely on what visitor gets

## Teaching Point
The hero must answer "What's in it for me?" in 5 seconds. Company accolades don't answer that question.

## When to Apply
Every landing page hero section. This is the most important real estate on your page—don't waste it on welcomes.

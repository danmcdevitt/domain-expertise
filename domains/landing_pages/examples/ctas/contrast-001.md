# CTA Button Text

## WEAK
"Submit"

### Why it's weak:
- No indication of what happens next
- Bureaucratic, not benefit-focused
- "Submit" implies giving something up
- Zero enthusiasm or urgency

## STRONG
"Get My Free Strategy Call"

### Why it works:
- "Get" is active—visitor receives value
- "My" creates ownership before clicking
- "Free" removes financial friction
- "Strategy Call" is specific—no mystery

## Teaching Point
The CTA should complete the sentence "I want to..." If "I want to submit" sounds wrong, change the button.

## When to Apply
All form buttons, sign-up flows, and conversion actions. Never use generic verbs when specific outcomes work.

# Core Principles: Landing Page Optimization

These are the non-negotiable truths that separate high-converting landing pages from digital brochures.

## 1. One Page, One Goal

Every element on the page should move the visitor toward a single action. Multiple CTAs, competing messages, or navigation that leads elsewhere kills conversion.

Why this matters: A confused visitor doesn't convert. Every exit point you add reduces your conversion rate.

## 2. The Hero Decides Everything

Visitors decide in 5 seconds whether to stay or leave. Your above-the-fold content must pass three tests: Who is this for? What do I get? Why should I care?

Why this matters: The majority of visitors never scroll. Your hero section is your only guaranteed impression.

## 3. Proof Before Promise

Claims without evidence are ignored. Lead with testimonials, case studies, logos, and specific results. Let the proof make your promises for you.

Why this matters: Visitors are skeptical. Third-party validation is more persuasive than self-promotion.

## 4. Remove Friction Ruthlessly

Every form field, every required decision, every moment of confusion reduces conversions. The path from interest to action must be frictionless.

Why this matters: People take the path of least resistance. Make it easier to convert than to leave.

## 5. Match the Message to the Moment

The landing page must continue the conversation started by the ad, email, or link that brought the visitor. Mismatched messages cause immediate bounce.

Why this matters: Visitors arrive with expectations. Breaking those expectations breaks trust.

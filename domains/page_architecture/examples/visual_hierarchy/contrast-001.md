# Focused Layout vs Distracted Layout

## WEAK
```
[Logo] [Home] [Products] [About] [Blog] [Contact]

"Our New Product"

[Sidebar: Related Posts]     [Main Content]     [Sidebar: Newsletter]

[Footer: 20+ links to other pages]
```

### Why it's weak:
- Full navigation provides 6+ exit paths
- Sidebars compete for attention
- Footer offers 20+ distractions
- Attention ratio is 1:25+ (one goal, 25 links)
- Visitor has too many choices
- CTA competes with everything else

## STRONG
```
[Logo only - no navigation]

"Our New Product Does X for You"

[Full-width content section]

[Single prominent CTA]

[Minimal footer: Privacy Policy | Terms]
```

### Why it works:
- No navigation = no exit paths
- Full-width content = no competing sidebars
- Attention ratio is 1:1 (one goal, one action)
- CTA has no competition
- Visitor can focus on the offer
- Every element supports conversion

## Teaching Point
Attention ratio matters. Research shows landing pages without navigation convert 65% higher than those with navigation. Every link that isn't your CTA is working against you.

## When to Apply
For any dedicated landing page (not homepage), remove all navigation and exit paths. The visitor came here for one thing—let them focus on it.

# Complete Hero vs Missing Elements

## WEAK
```
[Large decorative image of abstract shapes]

"Innovative Solutions for Tomorrow"

Learn More →
```

### Why it's weak:
- No primer—visitor doesn't know what this IS
- Headline is meaningless corporate speak
- No subheadline to expand on promise
- No body copy explaining how
- CTA "Learn More" gives no value indication
- Art is decorative, not informative

## STRONG
```
A short, 100-year-old book, declared essential reading for modern copywriters:

Write copy, confidently.

Stop feeling like an imposter. Start thinking, writing, and selling like a professional conversion copywriter.

This concise, 53-page book—packed with timeless, proven persuasion principles—will teach you how to create ads you're proud to deliver.

Get the Book → Save 50% (Flash sale ends tomorrow)

### Why it works:
- Primer eliminates confusion (it's a book for copywriters)
- Headline makes clear promise (write copy confidently)
- Subhead future-paces with "stop/start" language
- Body copy answers "how" (53 pages, proven principles)
- CTA shows value (get book, save 50%) with urgency
- Art shows the product with incentive visible

## Teaching Point
The hero must do a complete selling job. A stranger seeing only the hero should know: what it is, what they get, why they should care, and what to do next.

## When to Apply
Before launching any landing page, cover everything except the hero and ask: "Would someone know what this is and want it?"

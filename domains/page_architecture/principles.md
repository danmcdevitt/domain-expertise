# Page Architecture Principles

These principles govern the structural and visual design of landing pages. They are universal truths that apply regardless of audience, product, or traffic source.

## Principle 1: Single Conversion Goal

Every element on the page must support one defined conversion action. The "attention ratio" should be 1:1—one goal, no distractions.

This means:
- Remove top navigation (eliminates exit paths)
- Remove sidebar links
- Remove footer navigation links
- Every CTA points to the same action
- No competing offers or secondary goals

**Rule:** If an element doesn't support the conversion goal, it's working against it.

## Principle 2: Above-the-Fold Earns the Scroll

The hero section (above-the-fold content) must accomplish everything needed to make a visitor WANT to scroll. It must:
- Communicate the core value proposition immediately
- Make the visitor feel "this is for me"
- Create enough curiosity to continue
- Eliminate confusion about what this page is about

Essential above-the-fold elements:
- Primer copy (what this IS, for clarity)
- Headline (the big promise)
- Subheadline (expands on promise)
- Primary CTA or form
- Key visual (product, demo, or hero image)

**Rule:** If someone covers everything except the hero, they should know exactly what's being offered.

## Principle 3: The Slippery Slide

Every element must compel the visitor to read the next element. Joe Sugarman's principle: "Every element must be so compelling that you find yourself falling down a slippery slide unable to stop until you reach the end."

This requires:
- Each section answers the question raised by the previous section
- Visual hierarchy guides the eye downward
- Benefit statements pull readers forward
- No dead ends or stopping points

**Rule:** After reading any element, the visitor should feel compelled to read what comes next.

## Principle 4: Visual Hierarchy Matches Information Priority

Larger elements attract attention first. Visual prominence must match information importance:
- Most important = most visually prominent
- Headlines larger than body copy
- CTAs stand out from surrounding elements
- Whitespace creates focus, not emptiness

Directional cues reinforce the path:
- Images of people looking toward CTAs
- Arrow graphics pointing to forms
- Strategic whitespace guiding eye flow

**Rule:** A visitor scanning the page should "get" the message from just the largest elements.

## Principle 5: Whitespace is Not Empty Space

Whitespace creates breathing room for content AND for the visitor's mind. Cramped layouts overwhelm and create friction.

Benefits of generous whitespace:
- Improves comprehension
- Increases perceived quality
- Focuses attention on key elements
- Reduces cognitive load

**Rule:** When in doubt, double the padding. If the page feels overwhelming, add space, don't remove content.

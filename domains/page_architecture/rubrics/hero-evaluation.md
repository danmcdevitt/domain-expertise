# Hero Section Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose
Evaluate above-the-fold hero sections for conversion effectiveness.

## The 6 Hero Elements

A complete hero section contains:
1. **Primer** - Eliminates confusion (what this IS)
2. **Headline** - Makes the big promise
3. **Subheadline** - Expands on promise, future-paces
4. **Body copy** - Answers "how"
5. **CTA** - Clear next step with value
6. **Art** - Visualizes what visitor gets

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Instant Clarity (Weight: 35%)
- Can a stranger understand what's offered in 3 seconds?
- Is the product/service category immediately clear?
- Is there a primer that eliminates ambiguity?
- Does the headline make one clear promise?

**Red Flags:**
- Clever-over-clear headline
- Missing primer copy
- Visitor has to scroll to understand the offer
- Confusing imagery that doesn't match copy

### 2. Scroll Motivation (Weight: 25%)
- Does the hero create curiosity to learn more?
- Is there implied value below the fold?
- Does the subhead expand on the promise?
- Is there a reason to NOT just bounce?

**Red Flags:**
- Hero is complete but not compelling
- No hint of what's below
- Promise is too small to care about
- Subhead repeats headline instead of expanding

### 3. Visual Hierarchy (Weight: 25%)
- Is the headline the most prominent text element?
- Does the CTA stand out visually?
- Does whitespace focus attention?
- Do directional cues guide the eye?

**Red Flags:**
- CTA blends into background
- Multiple competing focal points
- Crowded layout with no breathing room
- Images that distract from the message

### 4. CTA Placement & Visibility (Weight: 15%)
- Is primary CTA visible without scrolling?
- Is it clear what clicking the CTA will do?
- Are anxiety reducers present near CTA?
- Is the CTA visually distinct (contrast, size)?

**Red Flags:**
- CTA below the fold on mobile
- CTA color matches other elements
- No supporting microcopy
- Multiple CTAs with different actions

# Page Flow Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose
Evaluate the sequential flow and structure of landing pages for conversion effectiveness.

## The Conversion Flow Pattern

Effective landing pages follow this sequence:
1. **Promise** (Hero) - What you'll get
2. **Proof** (Social proof, testimonials) - Why to believe it
3. **Process** (How it works) - The mechanism
4. **Product** (Features/benefits) - What's included
5. **Price** (Offer) - What it costs
6. **Push** (Final CTA) - Last chance to act

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Logical Progression (Weight: 30%)
- Does each section answer the question raised by the previous?
- Is the sequence problem → solution → proof → action?
- Does information appear in the order a visitor needs it?
- Are there any "jumps" that confuse the reader?

**Red Flags:**
- Price before value is established
- Features before problem is acknowledged
- CTA before objections are handled
- Testimonials before visitor knows what product is

### 2. Slippery Slide Effect (Weight: 25%)
- Does each section end with a reason to keep reading?
- Are there visual breaks that signal "more below"?
- Is there momentum from top to bottom?
- Would a scanner keep scrolling?

**Red Flags:**
- Dead ends where reader might stop
- Sections that feel complete without the next
- No visual cues to continue
- Long sections without subheadings

### 3. Objection Handling Sequence (Weight: 25%)
- Are common objections addressed before they become blockers?
- Is pricing/commitment info timed correctly?
- Are FAQs positioned near decision points?
- Is risk addressed before asking for commitment?

**Red Flags:**
- Asking for purchase before addressing concerns
- No FAQ or objection handling
- Risk not addressed (guarantee, trial, refund)
- Price shock without value buildup

### 4. CTA Distribution (Weight: 20%)
- Are CTAs repeated at logical intervals?
- Do all CTAs drive the same action?
- Is there a CTA visible when visitor is ready to convert?
- Are CTAs placed after compelling sections?

**Red Flags:**
- Only one CTA at the bottom
- Different CTAs with different actions
- Long stretches without conversion opportunity
- CTA before visitor is warmed up

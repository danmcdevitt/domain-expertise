# Curiosity Subject Lines

## WEAK
"November Newsletter - Company Updates & More!"

### Why it's weak:
- "Newsletter" screams promotional
- No specific value or curiosity
- "Updates & More" is meaningless
- Exclamation mark doesn't add enthusiasm

## STRONG
"The mistake that cost us our biggest client (and how we fixed it)"

### Why it works:
- Story format creates natural curiosity
- Vulnerability creates authenticity
- "How we fixed it" promises actionable content
- Lowercase feels personal, not promotional

## Teaching Point
Curiosity gaps work when they promise a specific insight. "Newsletter" never creates curiosity.

## When to Apply
Promotional emails, content emails, and re-engagement campaigns. Avoid for transactional emails where clarity beats curiosity.

# Core Principles: Email Marketing Copy

These are the non-negotiable truths that separate emails that get opened and clicked from those that get deleted.

## 1. The Subject Line Is the Entire Ad

Your email content doesn't matter if it's never opened. The subject line must earn the open—everything else is secondary.

Why this matters: 47% of recipients open email based on subject line alone. Brilliant body copy in an unopened email is worthless.

## 2. One Email, One Ask

Every email should have a single purpose and a single call to action. Multiple links and asks dilute attention and reduce clicks.

Why this matters: Confusion kills action. Each additional CTA reduces the click rate of all CTAs.

## 3. Write Like You Talk

Email is intimate. It lands in the same inbox as messages from friends and family. Corporate jargon and formal language trigger the spam filter in readers' brains.

Why this matters: People buy from people. Stiff copy creates distance; conversational copy creates connection.

## 4. The P.S. Gets Read

Many readers skip to the end. The P.S. is prime real estate for your most important point, your CTA, or a curiosity hook.

Why this matters: Eye-tracking studies show the P.S. is one of the most-read parts of any email.

## 5. Respect the Inbox

Every email you send trains subscribers how to treat your emails. Irrelevant or too-frequent emails train them to ignore you.

Why this matters: Email fatigue is real. The unsubscribe is just one click away.

# Action-Oriented CTAs

## WEAK
"Submit"

### Why it's weak:
- Zero benefit to the user—what happens after submit?
- Feels bureaucratic, like filling out a government form
- No emotional pull, no urgency
- "Submit" implies the user is giving something up

## STRONG
"Get My Free Audit Report"

### Why it works:
- "Get" is active—user is receiving value
- "My" creates ownership before they even click
- "Free" removes risk
- "Audit Report" is specific—they know what they'll receive

## Teaching Point
The CTA should complete the sentence "I want to..." Your reader should never have to guess what happens next.

## When to Apply
All form submissions, email signups, and download buttons. The button text should describe what the user gets, not what they're giving.

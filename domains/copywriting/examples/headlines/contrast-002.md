# Outcome Headlines

## WEAK
"Grow Your Business with Our Platform"

### Why it's weak:
- "Grow your business" could be any company's tagline
- "Our Platform" puts focus on the company, not the reader
- No measurable outcome—what does "grow" actually mean?
- Zero differentiation from competitors

## STRONG
"Add $50K to Your Pipeline in 90 Days—Or We Refund Your Setup Fee"

### Why it works:
- Specific dollar amount ($50K) is concrete and visualizable
- Specific timeframe (90 days) sets clear expectations
- Risk reversal (refund) removes purchase anxiety
- The reader can calculate ROI immediately

## Teaching Point
Specifics are evidence. Vague claims sound like marketing—specific numbers sound like facts.

## When to Apply
Use for solution-aware audiences who are evaluating options. Best when you can back the claim with case studies or a genuine guarantee.

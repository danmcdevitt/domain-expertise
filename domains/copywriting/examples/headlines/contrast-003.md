# Buzzword-Free Headlines

## WEAK
"Unlock Your Potential with Our Revolutionary AI-Powered Solution"

### Why it's weak:
- "Unlock potential" means nothing—slop red flag
- "Revolutionary" is instantly ignored—everyone claims this
- "AI-Powered" without specifying what it does
- Could be about literally anything—zero clarity

## STRONG
"Our AI Writes Your Cold Emails in 30 Seconds—Each One Personalized from the Prospect's LinkedIn"

### Why it works:
- Specific capability (writes cold emails in 30 seconds)
- Specific differentiator (personalized from LinkedIn)
- Reader understands exactly what the product does
- The time savings are immediately calculable

## Teaching Point
"AI-Powered" is slop. Say what the AI actually does, in terms the user experiences.

## When to Apply
When describing AI or tech capabilities. Always translate features into user-level outcomes.

# Problem-Agitation Headlines

## WEAK
"Are You Struggling with Lead Generation?"

### Why it's weak:
- Generic question that everyone ignores—we've seen it 1000 times
- "Struggling" is vague—could apply to any business problem
- No specific visual for the reader to picture
- Sounds like every other marketing automation company

## STRONG
"Still Manually Copying Leads from LinkedIn into Your CRM Every Morning?"

### Why it works:
- Specific action the reader actually does (copying from LinkedIn to CRM)
- Specific time (every morning) creates immediate recognition
- Reader can literally picture themselves doing this frustrating task
- Implies the solution is automation without saying "automation"

## Teaching Point
Specificity creates recognition. When readers can picture themselves in your headline, they keep reading.

## When to Apply
Use for problem-aware audiences who know they have a problem but haven't found a solution. Works especially well for cold traffic where you need to stop the scroll.

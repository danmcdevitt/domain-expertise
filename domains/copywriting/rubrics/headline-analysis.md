# Rubric: Headline Analysis

Evaluation framework for analyzing headlines in ads, landing pages, and emails.

## Scoring

### 5 - Exceptional
- Specific, measurable outcome that the reader can visualize
- Creates instant recognition ("that's exactly me")
- Differentiated from competitors—couldn't be swapped with another company
- Emotionally resonant without manipulation
- Matches the audience's awareness level perfectly
- Would work as a standalone statement

### 4 - Strong
- Clear value proposition with some specificity
- Addresses a real pain point or desire
- Distinct enough to stand out
- Good emotional connection
- Minor improvements possible

### 3 - Adequate
- Communicates a benefit
- Relevant to target audience
- Understandable on first read
- But generic—could be any competitor
- No specific outcome or proof
- Missing emotional connection

### 2 - Weak
- Vague or abstract language
- Focus on features rather than outcomes
- Could apply to almost any company
- Requires context to understand
- Uses buzzwords without substance
- Self-focused ("We are..." "Our product...")

### 1 - Slop
- Meaningless buzzwords ("revolutionary", "transform", "unlock potential")
- Completely vague ("Better results", "Grow your business")
- Self-congratulatory ("Industry-leading", "Award-winning")
- Could be about literally anything
- No clear benefit to the reader
- Actively confusing or misleading

## Red Flags (Instant Slop Indicators)
- "Transform" / "Revolutionary" / "Unlock"
- "AI-powered" without specific capability
- Addresses everyone = addresses no one
- Claims without proof mechanism
- "Best-in-class" / "World-class" / "Industry-leading"
- More than one complete idea
- Requires subhead to make sense
- Uses jargon the reader wouldn't use

## Evaluation Questions
1. Can I picture the specific person this is for?
2. Is the outcome measurable or at least visualizable?
3. Would a competitor's headline be interchangeable?
4. Does it pass the "so what?" test?
5. Would the target audience describe their problem this way?
6. Is there a reason to believe this claim?
7. Does it match the awareness level of the traffic source?

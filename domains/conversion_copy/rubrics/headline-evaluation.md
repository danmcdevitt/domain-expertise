# Headline Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose
Evaluate headlines for conversion effectiveness based on universal copywriting principles.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Clarity (Weight: 35%)
- Can a stranger understand what this is about in under 3 seconds?
- Is the core benefit immediately apparent?
- Are there any ambiguous words or phrases?
- Would removing any word break the meaning?

**Red Flags:**
- Industry jargon without explanation
- Abstract nouns ("solutions," "synergy," "leverage")
- Puns or wordplay that obscure meaning
- Requires context to understand

### 2. Promise Strength (Weight: 30%)
- Does it make a clear, specific promise?
- Is the promise believable given normal expectations?
- Is the promise desirable to someone with the problem?
- Is there a clear "what's in it for me"?

**Red Flags:**
- No clear benefit stated
- Promise too vague ("improve your life")
- Promise too grandiose to believe
- Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused

### 3. Specificity (Weight: 20%)
- Contains specific numbers, timeframes, or quantities?
- Names specific outcomes, methods, or results?
- Uses concrete language vs. abstract language?

**Red Flags:**
- Generic statements that could apply to anyone
- Vague qualifiers ("better," "faster," "easier")
- Missing "how much" or "how long"

### 4. Readability (Weight: 15%)
- Uses simple, common words?
- Short enough to read quickly?
- Active voice?
- Direct address (you/your)?

**Red Flags:**
- Long, complex sentence structure
- Passive voice construction
- Third person when second person would work
- Multiple clauses or nested ideas

## Evaluation Questions

1. If you covered everything except the headline, would a stranger know what's being offered?
2. Does the headline make you want to read the next line?
3. Could this headline work for a competitor's product? (If yes, it's not specific enough)
4. Does it speak to a specific person with a specific problem?
5. Is there a clear "before and after" implied?

## Scoring Guide

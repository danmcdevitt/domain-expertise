# Body Copy Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose
Evaluate landing page body copy for persuasion and clarity.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Promise-Proof Structure (Weight: 30%)
- Does the copy follow Headline Promise → How It Works → Evidence?
- Is each claim supported by proof?
- Does the body answer "how" after the headline promises "what"?

**Red Flags:**
- Claims without evidence
- Features without benefits
- No logical flow from promise to proof
- Missing the "how does it work" answer

### 2. Scanability (Weight: 25%)
- Can a scanner get the main points in 30 seconds?
- Are key benefits highlighted (bold, bullets, subheads)?
- Is there clear visual hierarchy in the text?
- Are paragraphs short (2-4 sentences max)?

**Red Flags:**
- Long, dense paragraphs
- No subheadings breaking up content
- Important points buried in text
- Wall of text without visual breaks

### 3. Customer Language (Weight: 25%)
- Does the copy sound like how customers describe their problem?
- Are customer words/phrases used (Voice of Customer)?
- Does it avoid corporate/marketing speak?
- Is it written in second person (you/your)?

**Red Flags:**
- Corporate jargon
- Third person writing about the company
- Language customers wouldn't use
- Insider terminology without explanation

### 4. Emotional-Rational Balance (Weight: 20%)
- Does it start with emotional engagement (problem, aspiration)?
- Does it transition to rational proof (features, specs, data)?
- Are both emotional and logical buyers addressed?
- Is there a clear "before and after" picture?

**Red Flags:**
- All features, no emotion
- All hype, no substance
- Missing transformation narrative
- No concrete proof points

## Copy Flow Checklist

1. [ ] Acknowledge the problem (you feel seen)
2. [ ] Agitate the pain (consequences of not solving)
3. [ ] Introduce the solution (there's a better way)
4. [ ] Explain how it works (mechanism/method)
5. [ ] Prove it works (evidence/proof)
6. [ ] Show the transformation (before/after)
7. [ ] Call to action (clear next step)

# CTA Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose
Evaluate Call-to-Action copy for conversion effectiveness.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Action Clarity (Weight: 30%)
- Does the visitor know exactly what will happen when they click?
- Is the action verb strong and specific?
- Is the next step obvious?

**Red Flags:**
- Vague verbs ("Submit," "Click Here," "Continue")
- Unclear what happens after clicking
- Multiple possible interpretations

### 2. Value Communication (Weight: 30%)
- Does the CTA communicate what the visitor GETS, not what they DO?
- Is the benefit of taking action clear?
- Does it create ownership ("Get MY free guide" vs "Download guide")?

**Red Flags:**
- Action-only language with no benefit
- Focus on what you want them to do vs. what they get
- Missing "what's in it for me"

### 3. Friction Reduction (Weight: 25%)
- Are objections addressed near the CTA? (click triggers)
- Is the commitment level clear?
- Are anxiety reducers present? (No credit card, Free, Cancel anytime)

**Red Flags:**
- High-friction words ("Buy Now" for cold traffic)
- No reassurance near the button
- Unclear commitment or cost
- Missing trust signals at decision point

### 4. Urgency/Incentive (Weight: 15%)
- Is there a reason to act now vs. later?
- Is urgency truthful and contextually appropriate?
- Is there an incentive that makes immediate action valuable?

**Red Flags:**
- Fake urgency or scarcity
- No reason to act now
- Urgency without specificity

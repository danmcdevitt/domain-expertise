# Conversion Copywriting Principles

These principles govern all persuasive copy on landing pages. They are universal truths that apply regardless of audience, product, or traffic source.

## Principle 1: Clarity Defeats Cleverness

Direct-response copy should never call attention to itself. As Eugene Schwartz taught: "The words in advertising are like the windows in a store. You must be able to look right through them and see the product."

If the reader notices the writing, they're not seeing the benefit. Clever wordplay, puns, and linguistic tricks distract from the message. Simple, clear language converts better than sophisticated prose.

**Rule:** If you can remove a word without losing meaning, remove it. If a simpler word exists, use it.

## Principle 2: Benefits Over Features

Customers buy outcomes, not inputs. They don't want the drill—they want the hole in the wall. They don't want the software—they want the time saved.

Every feature must be translated into a benefit statement. The benefit answers: "What does this mean for ME?"

**Pattern:** [Benefit statement] + with/through/using + [feature that delivers it]
Example: "Experience all-day comfort with our advanced cushioning technology."

## Principle 3: Specificity Creates Believability

Vague claims feel like marketing. Specific claims feel like facts.

- WEAK: "Save money on your next purchase"
- STRONG: "Save $47 on orders over $100 before Friday"

Specificity includes: numbers, timeframes, percentages, names, locations, methods. The more specific the claim, the more credible it becomes.

## Principle 4: One Big Beautiful Promise

Every piece of copy—headline, subhead, CTA—must support a single, clear promise. Multiple promises dilute impact and create confusion.

The promise must be:
- Relevant to the reader's situation
- Believable given the evidence
- Desirable enough to act on
- Clear enough to understand instantly

## Principle 5: Copy Readability Determines Conversion

Data shows landing pages written at a 5th-7th grade reading level convert 56% better than those at 8th-9th grade level. There is a -24.3% negative correlation between difficult words and conversion rates.

Use:
- Short sentences (under 20 words)
- Common words (avoid jargon)
- Active voice
- Second person ("you")
- Contractions (feels conversational)

# Value-Focused vs Action-Only CTAs

## WEAK
"Submit"

### Why it's weak:
- Tells visitor what to DO, not what they GET
- High-friction word associated with forms/bureaucracy
- No value communication whatsoever
- No reason to feel good about clicking
- Feels like work, not reward

## STRONG
"Get My Free Pricing Calculator → No Credit Card Required"

### Why it works:
- States what visitor RECEIVES (pricing calculator)
- Creates ownership with "My" (it becomes theirs)
- "Free" removes cost anxiety
- Click trigger "No credit card" removes commitment fear
- Arrow suggests forward progress

## Teaching Point
The CTA button copy should complete the sentence "I want to..." in the visitor's mind. "I want to submit" (no). "I want to get my free pricing calculator" (yes).

## When to Apply
Every CTA should pass the "I want to..." test. If the button text sounds bad completing that sentence, rewrite it.

# Truthful Urgency vs No Reason to Act

## WEAK
"Sign Up Now"

### Why it's weak:
- "Now" feels like pressure without justification
- No incentive for immediate action
- Visitor thinks "I'll do it later"
- No consequence of waiting
- Generic action anyone could take anytime

## STRONG
"Start My Free Trial → Only 7 Spots Left This Month (Resets Dec 1)"

### Why it works:
- Clear action with value (free trial)
- Specific scarcity (7 spots, not "limited")
- Truthful urgency (resets date given)
- Visitor understands why acting now matters
- Creates legitimate FOMO based on real constraint

## Teaching Point
Urgency works when it's truthful and specific. Fake urgency ("Limited time only!" forever) destroys trust. Real constraints—limited spots, deadline, inventory—create legitimate reasons to act now.

## When to Apply
Only use urgency when you have a real constraint. Better to have no urgency than fake urgency. If you have real limits, state them specifically.

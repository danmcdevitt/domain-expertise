# Specific Claims vs Vague Promises

## WEAK
"Get Better Results with Our Marketing Platform"

### Why it's weak:
- "Better results" is meaningless—better than what?
- No quantification or proof
- "Marketing platform" could be anything
- Generic claim any competitor could make
- Nothing memorable or specific

## STRONG
"The SEO Tool That Helped 3,939 Companies Grow Organic Traffic by 47% in 90 Days"

### Why it works:
- Exact number of companies (3,939 feels real, not rounded)
- Specific percentage improvement (47%)
- Defined timeframe (90 days)
- Clear category (SEO tool, organic traffic)
- Social proof built into the headline

## Teaching Point
Specificity creates believability. Specific numbers feel like facts. Round numbers feel like marketing. "47%" is more credible than "50%" because it implies real measurement.

## When to Apply
Whenever you have real data, use it. If you don't have data, get it—even from a small sample. "Helped 12 clients save an average of 6 hours per week" beats "Helps you save time."

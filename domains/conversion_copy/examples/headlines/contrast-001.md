# Clear Promise vs Clever Wordplay

## WEAK
"Synergize Your Workflow Solutions Today"

### Why it's weak:
- Abstract noun "synergize" means nothing concrete
- "Workflow solutions" is generic corporate speak
- No clear benefit—what do I GET?
- Could be written by any company in any industry
- Zero specificity about outcome or method

## STRONG
"Cut Your Team's Meeting Time in Half—Starting Tomorrow"

### Why it works:
- Specific outcome (cut meeting time in half)
- Concrete timeframe (starting tomorrow)
- Clear benefit I can visualize
- Speaks directly to a felt problem
- Impossible to misunderstand

## Teaching Point
Headlines that try to sound impressive often say nothing. The best headlines feel almost too simple—but that simplicity is what makes them convert.

## When to Apply
Use when evaluating any headline for conversion pages. Ask: "Would a stranger know exactly what this offers in 3 seconds?"

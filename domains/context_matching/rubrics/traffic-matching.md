# Traffic Source Matching Rubric

## Purpose
Evaluate if landing page elements match the traffic source context.

## Input Required
This rubric requires traffic source parameters:
- **Source Type:** Cold, Warm, or Hot
- **Platform:** Facebook, Google Search, Email, Direct, etc.
- **Ad/Email Content:** What did they click on?

## Traffic Temperature Definitions

### Cold Traffic
- **Sources:** Facebook ads, display ads, cold outreach
- **Intent Level:** Low (interrupted, not seeking)
- **Trust Level:** None (don't know you)
- **Typical Awareness:** Unaware or Problem Aware

### Warm Traffic
- **Sources:** Retargeting, email list, social followers
- **Intent Level:** Medium (some interest established)
- **Trust Level:** Some (know of you)
- **Typical Awareness:** Solution or Product Aware

### Hot Traffic
- **Sources:** Branded search, referrals, demo signups
- **Intent Level:** High (actively seeking)
- **Trust Level:** High (trust established)
- **Typical Awareness:** Product or Most Aware

## Matching Requirements

### Cold Traffic Pages
**Required elements:**
- Heavy social proof (logos, testimonials, stats)
- Strong risk reversal (guarantee, no CC free trial)
- Lower commitment CTA (free download, not purchase)
- More educational content
- Building problem awareness

**Red Flags:**
- Direct purchase ask
- Minimal social proof
- No guarantee or risk reversal
- Assumption of prior knowledge

### Warm Traffic Pages
**Required elements:**
- Moderate social proof
- Direct but not aggressive CTA
- Reference to prior touchpoints
- More focused value proposition
- Clear differentiation

**Red Flags:**
- Over-educating (they already know you)
- Too aggressive (still not ready to buy)
- Missing connection to how they know you

### Hot Traffic Pages
**Required elements:**
- Streamlined path to conversion
- Prominent CTA
- Offer details upfront
- Minimal friction
- Direct "here's how to buy" messaging

**Red Flags:**
- Too much content before offer
- Hidden pricing
- Unnecessary trust-building steps
- Asking for low-commitment action when they're ready for high

## Message Match Requirements

### For ALL Traffic
- Headline should echo what they clicked on
- Visual continuity from ad to page
- Same offer as advertised
- Same language/terminology as ad

**The Test:** If someone covered the ad and the page, would they match?

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Trust Element Calibration (Weight: 30%)
- Is social proof proportional to trust need?
- Cold = heavy proof, Hot = minimal proof
- Is risk reversal strength appropriate?

### 2. Commitment Ask Calibration (Weight: 30%)
- Is CTA commitment level appropriate?
- Cold = low ask, Hot = direct purchase okay
- Is there a pathway matching their readiness?

### 3. Content Depth Calibration (Weight: 25%)
- Is content length appropriate for temperature?
- Is education level appropriate?
- Is the starting point right for their knowledge?

### 4. Ad-to-Page Continuity (Weight: 15%)
- Does headline match ad copy?
- Does visual style match ad?
- Is the offer the same?

## Scoring Guide

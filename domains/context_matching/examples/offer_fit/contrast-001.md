### Why it's weak:
- "Newsletter" is vague—no specific value promised
- "Weekly updates" could be anything
- Phone number is huge ask for a newsletter
- Company info unnecessary for content
- No preview of what they'll actually receive
- Friction (4 fields) exceeds value (vague newsletter)
- Value exchange heavily favors the company

## Teaching Point
A lead magnet must feel like a gift, not a transaction. The visitor should think "I can't believe this is free" not "I guess I'll give my email for this."

## When to Apply
Before creating any lead capture, answer: "Would I give my email for this from a stranger?" If no, make the offer more valuable or the ask smaller.

# Matched vs Mismatched Awareness Level

## Context
Visitor is PROBLEM AWARE (knows they have a problem, doesn't know solutions exist)
Traffic source: Facebook ad about "wasting time on manual data entry"

## WEAK (Mismatched)
```
[Hero Section]
DataSync Pro - Enterprise Data Integration Platform

Features:
- API-first architecture
- Real-time sync engine
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- SOC 2 certified

Pricing starts at $299/month

```

### Why it's weak:
- Jumps straight to product features
- Assumes visitor knows what "data integration platform" means
- Uses jargon (API-first, SOC 2)
- Presents pricing before establishing value
- No problem acknowledgment
- No bridge from problem to solution
- Treats problem-aware visitor like most-aware

## STRONG (Matched)

Still Copying Data Between Spreadsheets Every Morning?

There's a better way.

Every hour you spend on manual data entry is an hour stolen from work that actually matters. And the errors? Those cost even more.

What if your data just... moved itself?

DataSync Pro automatically keeps your systems in sync, so your data is always where you need it—without touching a spreadsheet.

[No commitment. Takes 2 minutes.]
```

### Why it works:
- Starts where visitor is (problem recognition)
- Agitates the pain (time wasted, errors)
- Introduces solution category gently ("There's a better way")
- Explains what it does in plain language
- Low-commitment CTA (see how it works, not buy)
- Matches problem-aware → solution-aware journey

## Teaching Point
The copy must start where the visitor's mind is, not where you want them to be. A problem-aware visitor needs to be guided through solution awareness before they're ready for product features and pricing.

## When to Apply
Before writing ANY landing page, identify the visitor's awareness level. Then structure copy to take them from where they ARE to where you want them to be—one step at a time.

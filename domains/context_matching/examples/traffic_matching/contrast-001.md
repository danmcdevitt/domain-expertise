"Best email tool ever!" - John D.
```

### Why it's weak:
- Hard purchase ask to cold traffic (they just met you)
- Price upfront before value established
- No social proof beyond one weak testimonial
- No risk reversal
- No education or value building
- Assumes trust that doesn't exist
- Treats cold visitor like hot buyer

### Why it works:
- Low commitment ask (free video, no email)
- Specific, credible claim (1,247 subscribers, 30 days)
- Strong social proof (logos, specific testimonial)
- Maximum risk reversal (no email even required)
- Matches ad topic (email list growth)
- Builds trust before asking for anything

## Teaching Point
Cold traffic requires HEAVY trust-building and LOW commitment asks. They don't know you, don't trust you, and weren't looking for you. Your job is to earn the right to ask—which means giving value first.

## When to Apply
For any cold traffic landing page, audit: How much am I asking vs. how much have I proven? The colder the traffic, the lower the first ask should be, and the heavier the proof.

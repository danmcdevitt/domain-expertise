# Context Matching Principles

These principles govern HOW to evaluate whether landing page elements match the audience context. The actual audience context (awareness level, traffic source, intent) is provided externally by FunnelGenius.

## Principle 1: Message Match is Everything

The landing page must continue the conversation started before the visitor arrived. Every element must align with:
1. What is being offered
2. What the person was looking for
3. Their current awareness level and intent

A mismatch creates cognitive dissonance. If someone clicks an ad about "email automation" and lands on a page about "marketing solutions," they bounce.

**Rule:** The headline should feel like a direct continuation of what brought them here.

## Principle 2: Awareness Level Determines Message Complexity

The visitor's stage of awareness dictates the required copy length, tone, and complexity:

| Awareness Level | Copy Requirement |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Unaware | Educate on problem existence first |
| Problem Aware | Agitate pain, introduce solution category |
| Solution Aware | Differentiate your specific solution |
| Product Aware | Overcome objections, provide proof |
| Most Aware | Present offer with urgency |

Mismatching creates friction:
- Solution-aware copy to unaware visitor = confusion
- Educational copy to most-aware visitor = impatience

**Rule:** The copy sophistication must match what the visitor already knows.

## Principle 3: Traffic Temperature Determines Trust Requirement

Traffic sources carry different intent levels and trust baselines:

| Traffic Type | Intent | Trust Level | Requirement |
|--------------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Cold (Facebook, display) | Low | None | Heavy trust-building, education |
| Warm (email list, retargeting) | Medium | Some | Moderate proof, direct offer |
| Hot (branded search, referral) | High | High | Minimal proof, direct CTA |

Cold traffic needs more:
- Social proof
- Risk reversal
- Educational content
- Lower-commitment first step

**Rule:** The trust-building effort must match the visitor's starting trust level.

## Principle 4: The Offer Must Match the Commitment Level

What you ask must be proportional to what the visitor is ready to give:

| Visitor State | Appropriate Ask |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Cold, unaware | Free content, email signup |
| Warm, considering | Free trial, demo |
| Hot, ready to buy | Purchase, call |

Mismatching creates friction:
- Asking cold visitors to buy = abandonment
- Asking hot visitors to just download a guide = missed revenue

**Rule:** Match the commitment ask to the visitor's readiness level.

## Principle 5: Value Exchange Must Be Clear and Proportional

The visitor gives something (email, money, time). They must perceive receiving MORE value than they give.

For email capture: The lead magnet must feel valuable enough to justify giving an email.
For purchase: The perceived value must exceed the price.
For demo signup: The potential benefit must outweigh the time investment.

**Rule:** If what you're asking for feels too big for what you're offering, either increase your offer value or decrease your ask.
